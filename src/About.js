      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I am a dedicated IT professional with a strong foundation in project management and a wide range of technical skills. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Missouri and have worked on diverse projects, applying skills like Python, C#, MySQL, Firebase, Swift, and MongoDB in both professional and academic settings.

      A key project I developed is SitesMobile, an iOS app for the University of Missouriâ€™s Computing Sites program, streamlining work task logging and progress tracking. The app includes features like user authentication, live location tracking, form submissions, and issue tracking, replacing older systems.

      My experience also includes managing projects with Jira and GitHub, ensuring timely and high-quality results. Alongside my IT experience, I have a background in cybersecurity, with experience in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.

      I am seeking opportunities to contribute my IT skills, manage projects, and further develop my expertise.
